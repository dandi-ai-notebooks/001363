                    "thinking": "The notebook contains several well-executed plots:\n    1. Trial duration and ITI distribution histograms (double plot)\n    2. Raw neural data visualization for 4 channels\n    3. Power spectra plot showing frequency analysis\n    4. Trial-averaged responses plot for 4 channels\n    5. Time-frequency representation plot\n    6. Trial raster plot\n    7. Trial-averaged response comparison plot for 4 channels between two files\n\nThese plots effectively demonstrate various aspects of the data including temporal patterns, frequency content, trial structure, and neural responses. The plots use different visualization types (histograms, line plots, spectrograms, raster plots) and show both single-trial and trial-averaged data. Each plot serves a distinct analytical purpose and reveals different aspects of the neural recordings.",
